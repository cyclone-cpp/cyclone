        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Cyclone is a revolutionary web framework that combines the elegant design and developer-friendly conventions of Ruby on Rails with the raw power and performance of C++. Our mission is to create the fastest, most maintainable web framework for applications that demand both speed and code clarity.</p>
